# Path-Planning-Using-Reinforcement-Learning

This project demonstrates the application of Q-learning in solving a maze with obstacles. The goal of the agent (robot) is to navigate from a start position to an exit while avoiding obstacles. The agent learns optimal paths by interacting with the environment using reinforcement learning techniques.
